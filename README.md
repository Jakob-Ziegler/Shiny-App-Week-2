# Shiny-App-Week-2
This will contain all of the code for the Shiny App I created this week for Exploratory Data Analysis
It will allow for the user to look at a noramlized heat map of all the midwest states 
The user also has the option to look at just one of the midwest states, or they can comepare two of the midwest states if they choose to
When they select just the one state or to compare two states, the state(s) will be broken up into the counties.
Here is the link to the App:
